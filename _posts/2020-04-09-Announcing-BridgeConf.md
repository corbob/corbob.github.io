## The Why

What is the best part of the PowerShell community?
That's an excellent question.
As a community, we have numerous places to gather and exchange ideas, obtain advice, share our expertise, form relationships that extend beyond the confines of an office building.
One of those places is [Discord](https://pwsh.ca/discord) and [Slack](https://pwsh.ca/slack) as well as on Freenode in the #powershell channel.
The Discord and Slack are bridged together by a bot.
This bot also loops in Freenode in a channel known as #bridge.
This community is far and away the most accepting and helpful community I have found online.
At any given time there are people there to answer questions (sometimes more than just PowerShell).

## The What

As a way to celebrate the spirit of #bridge in the time of COVID-19 and social distancing making in-person events non-existent, we are excited to announce #BridgeConf.
 #BridgeConf is a one-day single track livestreamed conference-style event for PowerShell, automation, programming, infrastructure, sysadmin, and other miscellaneous nerds around the world.
This event doesnâ€™t have a singular focus, but it is born from the PowerShell Discord/Slack community.

## The When

April 30, 2020 from 08:00 PDT until approximately 17:15 PDT (that's 8:00 AM until 5:15 PM).

## The Where

This entirely virtual conference will be livestreamed to [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/bridgeconf).
Following the conference, we will be doing our best to edit and split the stream into it's corresponding sessions to be posted to YouTube.

## The Who

Hopefully you!
Seriously, we need you and others like you to submit proposals for sessions.
[The Call for Proposals is open](https://papercall.io/bridgeconf) so
